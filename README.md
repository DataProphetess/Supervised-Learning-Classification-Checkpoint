What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, we are going to work on the 'Systemic Crisis, Banking Crisis, inflation Crisis In Africa' dataset that was provided by Kaggle.
Dataset description : This dataset focuses on the Banking, Debt, Financial, Inflation and Systemic Crises that occurred, from 1860 to 2014, in 13 African countries, including: Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The ML model objective is to predict the likelihood of a Systemic crisis emergence given a set of indicators like the annual inflation rates.
